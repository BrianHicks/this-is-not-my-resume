# This is not my Resumé.

Hey there, fellow human being. You've found my GitHub page. Congratulations! I hope you don't hate it.

Here's what you're looking at:

 - A scratch pad of work which I've open sourced over years of learning to program.
 - Ideas I've had, but never had the time or gumption to fully flesh out or finish.
 - Projects which I use day-to-day, and which I hope you can use too.
 - Really bad JavaScript.

This is online in the hope that you can learn from it in the way I've learned from looking at other people's code. The code herein is far from perfect but in some cases is useful, at least to me.

With that said: This is not my resumé. I may put some of these projects on a resumé if I want a someone to see them as such, but please remember that this is an unfiltered dumping ground for code. I want to keep it public, because it's been helpful for me to look at other people's raw unfiltered dumps of code.

Thanks,

Brian Hicks

## The Ask

If you feel the same way I do about this, and want to help me out: star this repo. It's obviously not useful way down in my project list, and GitHub (currently) uses stars to decide which to show on your public profile page. If you want to fork this or write your own, let me know and I'll do the same for you.
